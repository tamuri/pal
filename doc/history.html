			growth demographic model, new features in IntervalsExtractor, new
			classes DemographicTree/ClockTree.  Reorganization of math and statistics
			packages: new binomial, error and gamma functions in math package, and

			(command applications moved into the Vanilla package). More efficient multivariate
			minimization classes (non-linear conjugate gradient algorithms, line function
			with boundaries, conjugate direction method with boundaries etc.) and improved
			stop criteria. Automatic model selection among amino acids matrices. Inclusion
			of the VT rate matrix. Estimation of model parameters without a tree. Several

			All classes are now fully documented using JavaDoc comments. Source
			code complies to Java 1.0 language standard to allow compilation into native
			code. Classes for evaluation of evolutionary hypotheses (chi-square and
			likelihood computation) and interfaces for functions and of Parameterized
			are reorganized. Detail improvements in a number of other classes. Introduction
			of clock-constraint on trees. Some minor bug fixes. New platforms: direct
			support for Windows and Unix-native (includes instructions for compilation
			into native code using the GNU Compiler for Java). New applications: UPGMA
			(constructs UPGMA tree), STRIPSITES (strips sites from an alignment according
			to a given order). LSTREE and MLTREE now enable the estimation of clock-like
			branch lengths. (February 2000).
